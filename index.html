   <p>At Masila Falls water cascades from less than 100 feet, which many find to be safe. The parking lot is located just 200 metres away from the falls, The construction of separate toilet blocks for men and women, changing room for women and parking facilities have contributed for the increase in tourist flow to Masila Falls in the recent times.</p>

    <p> Two people, one car, one destination and 70 hairpin bends. You read that right! 70 hairpin bends are what you need to negotiate through to reach Kolli Hills—which grimly translates into ‘Mountains of Death. Infamous for 70 continuous hairpin bends, the Kolli Hill Road is not for the faint-hearted. Located in Tamil Nadu.</p>
    <p> We both are fond of road trips and we keep on searching for destinations that are interesting and unexplored. </p>
